# Cinema Ticket Reservation System – Project Documentation

This repository contains the complete system design documentation for an **online cinema ticket reservation platform**.  
The project focuses on **system analysis, modeling, data structure design, and business logic definition**, created as part of a university course in Software Engineering.

Although this project does **not include implementation code**, it demonstrates skills in **UML modeling, database design, requirements analysis, and technical documentation** — all essential abilities for backend, data, and software engineering roles.

## Project Overview

The purpose of the system is to enable users to:

- browse movie schedules  
- reserve and purchase tickets  
- select seats in real time  
- generate digital tickets  
- process payments  

The documentation provides a detailed description of how such a system should work from both functional and technical perspectives.
